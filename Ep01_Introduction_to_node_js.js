-- History of NodeJS

jaha javascript hai wha javascript engine hai. without javascrpt engine, javascript run nhi ho sakta

but Ryan ne javascript engine use nhi kia while developing NodeJS
he used Spider Monkey (use in Firefox)

but after 2 days he chenged to V8

Joyent ek company thi jo ki javascript ko server per lana chahti thi and they met together and works on nodeJS


Joyent internally use krne la NodeJS 


Earlier it was WebJS not NodeJS (because phle Webserver ke liye bna rhe the)


but after when he realize te full potential of NodeJS he chenged to NodeJS


  */

/*



Reason behind creation of NodeJS
- Apache server was a blocking server, and Ryan wanted non blocking I/O

Adv of Non blocking -> it can handle multiple request with less no of request
